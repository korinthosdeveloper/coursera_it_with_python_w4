This is my solution to Coursera course:
"Automate real world problems with python" by
Google in IT profesional certificate.
The solution is for week 4 challenge.
You can get 20/25 with my solution.
But be carefull: 
The report is not pass the test! Even if creates the pdf, I dont know why 
but you can still pass the exam with 20/25.
good luck!
